# [Boycott Paper](http://boycottpaper.com)

Here's the source code for the comic series, Boycott Paper. This is a port of the original Boycott Paper code base that
was originally written in Python/Django:
[https://github.com/mullanaphy/boycottpaper](https://github.com/mullanaphy/boycottpaper). I no longer wanted to support
Python on my personal server, so I just copied over what I recreated for
[Heroes of Cuteness](https://www.heroesofcuteness.com/).

Please note, the source code is completely free to use while any and all actual content on the site is not based on this
