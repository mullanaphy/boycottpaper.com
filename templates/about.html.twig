        <p>There's not too much to say about this comic or myself really but I'll try and add any background info I can
            just in case.</p>
        <p>As far as I'm concerned most comics can suffice as one or four panels thanks to a childhood filled with <a
                    href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Far_Side">The Far Side</a> and <a
                    href="http://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes">Calvin and Hobbies</a>. So majority of my comics will
            be in one of those two formats, sometimes a story may need a different amount yet that should be the norm
            here.</p>
        <p>You'll also probably find some influences from The Far Side in my comics and for that I apologize for
            nothing. So, please enjoy my comics and if you like what I write please consider supporting the comic if you
            can at <a href="http://www.patreon.com/boycottpaper">Patreon</a>.</p>
